## Instructions for Converting PyTorch Code to Jittor Framework
This folder is for converting the code of this method from the PyTorch framework to the Jittor framework. Please use the [main_finetune.py](https://github.com/thislzm/Remote-Sensing-RVSA/new/main/MAEPretrain_SceneClassification/jittor/main_finetune.py)
script and modify the parameters such as '--data_path', '--torch_path', and '--jittor_path' according to your file storage structure.
